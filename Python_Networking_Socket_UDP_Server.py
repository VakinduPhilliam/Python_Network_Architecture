# Python Stream Networking
# Streams are high-level async/await-ready primitives to work with 
# network connections. 
# Streams allow sending and receiving data without using callbacks 
# or low-level protocols and transports.
# The socketserver module simplifies the task of writing network servers.
# socketserver.UDPServer Example
# Server side:
 
import socketserver

class MyUDPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
    """
    This class works similar to the TCP handler class, except that
    self.request consists of a pair of data and client socket, and since
    there is no connection the client address must be given explicitly
    when sending data back via sendto().
    """

    def handle(self):

        data = self.request[0].strip()
        socket = self.request[1]

        print("{} wrote:".format(self.client_address[0]))
        print(data)

        socket.sendto(data.upper(), self.client_address)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
    with socketserver.UDPServer((HOST, PORT), MyUDPHandler) as server:
        server.serve_forever()
