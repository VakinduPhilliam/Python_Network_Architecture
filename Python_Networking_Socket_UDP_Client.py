# Python Stream Networking
# Streams are high-level async/await-ready primitives to work with 
# network connections. 
# Streams allow sending and receiving data without using callbacks 
# or low-level protocols and transports.
# The socketserver module simplifies the task of writing network servers.
# Client side:
 
import socket
import sys

HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
data = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])

# SOCK_DGRAM is the socket type to use for UDP sockets

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# As you can see, there is no connect() call; UDP has no connections.
# Instead, data is directly sent to the recipient via sendto().

sock.sendto(bytes(data + "\n", "utf-8"), (HOST, PORT))
received = str(sock.recv(1024), "utf-8")

print("Sent:     {}".format(data))
print("Received: {}".format(received))
